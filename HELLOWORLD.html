I dont want to show clothes, want to show my attitude, my past, present and future. I use memories and future visions and try to place them in todays world. <p>most important message Raf Simons wants to communicate is: <br><br><br> <strong><u>PRIDE IN INDIVIDUALITY. </u></strong><br><br>

<p>Fuelled by his love for both rebellious youth cultures and traditional menswear, he emerges in fashion halfway through the nineties, presenting a radically different image of masculinity. Fusing the energy and singularity of teenage subcultures with the sharpness and precision of classical sartorial craft, the look presented by Raf Simons is both inspired by and designed for confident outsiders.</p>
<p style="margin-top:40px;">From the first collection on, music, art, performance, images and words have a substantial role in the whole package, summing up, or rather clarifying the kind of world Raf Simons wants to project. Always at the core of his universe (and as essential as the clothes themselves) are attitudes, moods and statements about individuality and independence.</p>
<p> Equally important in Raf Simons' approach is the constant quest for innovation. The designs are always looking for the now and tomorrow, even if they are inspired by historical or classical references. Throughout the years, with the signature style evolving and maturing, the key elements stay the same: modern proportions, a constant research for fabrics and textures and above all the interplay of pure construction and new shapes with the body and psyche of the contemporary man.</p>
